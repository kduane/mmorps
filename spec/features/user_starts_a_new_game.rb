# Upon first visit of the app the user starts a new game against a computer opponent.
# The user can choose one of three options (rock, paper, or scissors) by submitting an HTML form.
# When the user submits their choice, the computer AI randomly chooses one of the three options and the winner receives a point. If there is a tie there is no point awarded.
# When a user submits their choice, refreshing the page should not re-submit that choice again (use the Post/Redirect/Get pattern to avoid this scenario).
# The first player to win best-of-three is declared the winner.
# Once the game has been won, the user has an option to restart the game.
# The app should be able to support multiple games simultaneously. This can be tested by visiting the page in multiple browsers or private browsing sessions to ensure they are using different sessions.
# No JavaScript should be used.
# No game state should be persisted on the server (i.e. no databases or files should be used).
